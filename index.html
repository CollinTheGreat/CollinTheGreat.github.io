    <h4>A tutorial about WordPress and Elementor for the Gilman Methodist Church website</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hopefully this tutorial will teach you some basic stuff about how you can edit the church website! We are going to be working on a page that I created called "Practice" (this page is not accessible to anyone visiting the site). We're first going to start off with how to navigate around WordPress</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Navigating WordPress</h2>
    <h4>What is WordPress?</h4>
    <p>WordPress is a really popular way to edit websites. WordPress is also really complicated. When you first open it up you see all these buttons and text that you will probably never need to worry about. Let's start with the basics.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Getting to WordPress</h4>
    <p>Getting to the WordPress editor is not too difficult. You simply start by entering the web address into your browser, then add <i>/wp-admin</i> to the end. In this case it would be:</p>
    <!-- Pic of site address -->
    <p>Then login with the username: gilmanumc and password: jesusjoyofme. You should see something like this</p>
    <!-- Pic of main wordpress dash -->
    <p>It may look a little bit different than what is pictured above. WordPress calls this main page the "Dashboard". Often times they will post news about their company or even ask for donations (ignore that stuff). Now what does all this stuff do? As I mentioned before the majority of this stuff you won't need so I'll go over the essentials.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Media Library</h4>
    <p>Your media library is just a fancy way of saying your pictures. To access your pictures click the "Media" button on the left sidebar</p>
    <!-- Pic with media highlighted -->
    <p>You should now be able to see what pictures have been uploaded to WordPress. Not all of these pictures are actually on the website though. What I'm going to show you how to do here is how to upload a image to WordPress, you'll learn how to put it on the actuall website later.</p>
    <p>Now at the top of the Media Library you will find a button labeled "Add New". As you have probably guessed, this is how you add new pictures. When you click it, this big box will pop up with another button in the middle labeled "Select Files", go ahead and click that as well. </p>
    <!-- Pic  -->
    <p>What will pop up then is your file manager. From there you go to the folder where the picture you want is located (Mine will probably look slightyly different). </p>
    <!-- Pic -->
    <p>Then click the picture you would like to add and click "Open" in the bottom right.</p>
    <p>Now your image will upload! (You'll see my Cavs image there too).</p>
    <p>Now what if you want to delete one or more of the pictures you aren't using? Easy. Click the "Bulk Select" button.</p>
    <!-- Pic -->
    <p>Now click the pictures you want to get rid of, then click "Delete Selected" up at the top.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Your Pages</h4>
    <p>Now lets check out the website's different pages.</p>
    <p>Click the "Pages" button on the left sidebar. *If you want to go back to the main Dashboard, the button for that is on the left sidebar all the way to the top.</p>
    <!-- Pic -->
    <p>Now you see all of the pages in the website! If you scroll through them you'll see that they are in alphabetical order. "About" is at the top and if you go all the way to the bottom you'll see the "Practice" page that I set up. We'll get back to that soon but for now let's look at something else.</p>
    <!-- Pages page pic -->
    <br>
    <h4>Events</h4>
    <p>This is where you can post things on the "Events Calendar" page</p>
    <!-- Pic -->
    <p>Now you may already know about how to add events but I am going to go through it anyway. This is what the events page looks like:</p>
    <!-- Pic -->
    <p>Already now lets create a new event together! Let's start by clicking the "Add New Event" button at the top.</p>
    <!-- Pic -->
    <p>First let's make the title. Let's call it: "Breakfast for Dinner". The title goes in the textbox at the top. In the bigger box below that, you can add a little description. You can use your creative liberties here.</p>
    <!-- Pic -->
    <p>Now scroll down to the Event Details section. Here you select what day and time the event will be. Click on the box next to "Start Time" and a cool little calendar will pop up. Now navigate to the date and time the event starts (The time is in military time to avoid confusion about A.M. vs P.M. Unfortunatley, this is how it will show up on the actual calendar so I would include the times in normal A.M and P.M format in the title or description). Now go  ahead and do the same thing for the end date and time! You don't need to worry about anything else in the Event Details section. </p>
    <!-- Pic of mini calendar thing -->
    <p>Now scroll down to the "Calendars" section. Nothing too much to do here, just make sure that the "Events Calendar" is checked and nothing else. It should look like this by default.</p>
    <!-- Pic of calendars section -->
    <p>Those are the basics of the events calendar!</p>
